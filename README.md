1. Executive Summary
This document outlines the design, development, and implementation of the project titled "phishing url detector", undertaken as part of the Hack Culprit Virtual Internship. The objective was to build a practical, technically sound solution using modern tools and frameworks. The project enhances key skills such as problem-solving, collaboration through GitHub, and real-world application of theoretical knowledge.

2. Problem Statement
Phishing attacks are one of the most prevalent and dangerous cyber threats, often involving deceptive URLs that mimic legitimate websites to trick users into revealing sensitive information such as login credentials, banking details, or personal data. With increasing sophistication in phishing techniques, traditional rule-based methods are no longer sufficient to detect and prevent such attacks effectively.

The goal of this project is to develop a Phishing URL Detector that can accurately identify and classify URLs as legitimate or phishing. The system will analyze features such as domain structure, presence of suspicious keywords, use of IP-based URLs, HTTPS presence, URL length, redirections, and other lexical or host-based indicators. Machine learning algorithms may be employed to improve detection accuracy and adapt to evolving phishing tactics.

This tool will help users, browsers, or email filters to detect and block phishing attempts in real-time, thus strengthening cybersecurity awareness and protection against social engineering attacks.

3. Project Objectives
To gain practical exposure to full-cycle software development
